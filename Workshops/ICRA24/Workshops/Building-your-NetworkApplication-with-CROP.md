## Creating your Network Applications:

### 1) Demonstration: Relay in connected robotics (BUT)
### 2) Demonstration: How to build a networked object detector in unstructured network (BUT)
### 3) Demonstration: How to build a tele-operation app in unstructured network (WINGS)
### 4) Demonstration: Onboarding and deploying the newly created network applications with orchestration (BED)
### 5) Hand on experience to the newly created ROS applications for connected robotics (Users, assisted by all)
