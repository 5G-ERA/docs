## ROS & CROP

### 1) Demonstration: limitation of ROS2 DDS (BUT)
### 2) Hand on experience of remote object detection in unstructured networks (BUT)
### 3) Hand on experience of obstacle avoidance in unstructured networks (BUT)
### 4) Demonstration: Behind scene story, fully orchestrated infrastructure automation (BED)

Current enviroment in robotics:

Strucuted Lab/environment
-QoS is fixed
-Network topology is static
-Single domain
-Single administration

Real enviroment:

Unstructured real-world settings:
-QoS changes constantly
-network topology is dynamic
-Mutlti domain co-exists
-multi admin

CROP provides an ecosystem and development environment for robot developers to build large scale distributed robotics.
Enable 5G enchaned cloud robotics to adapt robots automatically over the difital world.

-Ensure intelligent robot deployment in dynamic iunstructured network enviroments. 
-Software controlled instantiation of virtual networks meeting the requirements of the vertical.
-Adaptive autonomy on delivering the frictionless integration between the robot deployment and digital environment.
