# Middleware

Middleware delivers the unified communication protocol between robots and vertical applications running in the cloud. Middleware plays the role of the intermediary between them and allows the dynamic assessment of the robot requirements to conduct the designated task. 

Middleware enables this functionality by deploying the network applications on demand with the inclusion of the current robot's situation.

5G-ERA Middleware allows robots from different vertical sectors to use 5G-based digital
skills to enhance their autonomy. The Middleware is the link between vertical applications
managed by ROS and 4G infrastructure managed by OSM. It realises the 5G-ERA intentbased network using cloud-native design. The Middleware can be instantiated in the core
network either in the Edge Machines or in the cloud. The implementation allows the Robot to
request the instantiation of the cloud-native resources that will support the execution of the
task.

The Middleware documentation is divided into four sections:
* architecture - describes the architecture of the 5G-ERA Middleware and its components
* configuration - presents the tutorials how to install and configure 5G-ERA Middleware
* interface - showcases the ways how Middleware interacts with other services and possible integration guidelines
* usage - this section describes how to use 5G-ERA Middleware from the end-user point of view

5G-ERA Middleware documentation relies heavily on abbreviations. From the full list of abbreviations please visit [glossary](glosary).
