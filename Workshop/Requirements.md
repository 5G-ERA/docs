# Workshop technical requirements.

This document presents the requirements for all the participants of the hands-on part of the workshop organized by BED. 

## Hands-on workshop

The main requirement is the Virtual Machine with the Docker and Microk8s installed. 
The pre-prepared Ubuntu Desktop machine is available for download in the link below.

In case if anyone would like to use their own machine, the configuration instructions for the Ubuntu based distros are in the [VM_Configuration.md](VM_Configuration.md) file.

The machine is pre-configured with the recommended system requirements of 2 CPU cores and 8GB of RAM. The VM has also configured 2 network cards. One for the internet access, and the second Host-only NIC, for the easier communication with SSH if preferred. 

## OSM configuration

In the later part the capabilities of the OSM will be showcased. This part is optional to follow. If you decide to take follow the hands-on part of the workshop, the local OSM environment has to be configured. 

It requires 4 machines to be configured in order to have the full functionality of the system. It is recommended to have a lot of resources available on the local computer or to install the environment in the local server available for multiple users.

The Virtual Machines used as a base for the OSM installation are provided in the links below.

The detailed installation instructions are located in the [OSM installation guide](./../OSM/OSM_installation_and_configuration_for_DEV_environment.md).
